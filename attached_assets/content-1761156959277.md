## Rules

**This market is a social experiment to gauge social sentiment. To ensure a fair playground for all, there will be no trading fees charged for this market by Myriad. This market is TRADING ONLY and will never be resolved towards either option. Proceed at your own risk.**

Winning or losing? To be or not to be? _Up or Down?_

Questions that have been asked since the dawn of time, maybe even before. But is it more than a societal belief that pits us against each other?

To begin grasping a potential path to an answer, we must first acknowledge that there isn’t one. Like a caveman transported to Woodstock ‘69, we must attempt to understand the crowd that we are simultaneously part of and apart from—a crowd that behaves unpredictably based on predictable events and continues to surprise us while seemingly never changing.

Only then—once humbled, emboldened, and full of wonder—we can ask ourselves and the atoms around us the ever-ringing question, the itch at the back of our brains, the perpetrator of too many sleepless nights: **Up or Down?**

**Market Period:** Infinite. Do not give heed to any calendar dates, as they are but a mere distraction

**Resolution Criteria:**

- This market will not resolve

**Resolution Details:**

- No resolution can be triggered in this market

**Cancelation (Invalidity) Conditions:**

This market will be canceled/invalid if:

- Myriad Markets undergoes a change of its contract that demands the cancelation of all active markets, or similar technical or business imperatives
- Myriad Markets decides it is time for this market to cease to exist

In the event of cancelation, participants may claim their stakes at the market value of their open positions at the time of cancelation. This could result in a profit or a loss, depending on the price of their outstanding shares.
